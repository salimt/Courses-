## Course Description

Learn to code in Java and improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. At the end of the course you will build a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files. 

## After completing this course you will be able to:

- Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
- Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
- Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
- Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
- Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
- Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
- Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
- Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Some code could be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2">here</a>.
