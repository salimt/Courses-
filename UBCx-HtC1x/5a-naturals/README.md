# Module Overview

### This module deals with functions operating on Natural numbers. It turns out that this builds naturally on the self-reference module.

The last video in the module is a bit of brain candy. Or perhaps it's a brain http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobstopper. It's kind of wild, and intended to show you how much power you wield as a program designer. Have fun with it. But if it's too much feel free to come back to it later. If you do master it then avoid the temptation to tell people you meet about it at a party. You may find them smiling politely and backing away from you a bit.
### Learning Goals

- Be able to design functions that operate on natural numbers.
- Be able to design a simple alternative representation for natural numbers.

### Planning Your Time

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 3-4 hours of dedicated time to complete.
