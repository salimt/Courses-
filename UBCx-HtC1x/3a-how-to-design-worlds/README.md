# Module Overview

### How to Design Worlds

In this module you will learn how to design interactive programs that use the DrRacket big-bang functionality. We will make simple animations of animals walking across the screen that can be controlled by the keyboard and the mouse. In learning this process we also cover basic techniques for systematizing your work on larger programs. This module is complemented by the Compound module, which allows us to create more complex data definitions, that in turn support more complex world programs.

NOTE: Several of the videos in this module are quite long. That is because they work through the entire process of designing an interactive program. As a result, much of what the videos cover is not new. Instead it is HtDF and HtDD problems you already know how to do. We could have made the videos shorter by only including the new material, but many students have told us that they appreciate the longer videos because it helps them see how all the pieces fit together. As always, we suggest that you use some of these videos as a kind of TA tutorial hours - try to work the problem on your own and check in with the video now and then to see how your solution compares to ours.


### Learning Goals

- Be able to explain the inherent structure of interactive graphical programs.
- Be able to use the How to Design Worlds (HtDW) recipe to design interactive programs with atomic world state.
- Be able to read and write big-bang expressions.


### Planning Your Time

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take approximately 3-6 hours of dedicated time to complete.
