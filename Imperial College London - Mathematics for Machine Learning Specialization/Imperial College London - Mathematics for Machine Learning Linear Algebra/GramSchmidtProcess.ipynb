    "## Instructions\n",
    "In this assignment you will write a function to perform the Gram-Schmidt procedure, which takes a list of vectors and forms an orthonormal basis from this set.\n",
    "As a corollary, the procedure allows us to determine the dimension of the space spanned by the basis vectors, which is equal to or less than the space which the vectors sit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start by completing a function for 4 basis vectors, before generalising to when an arbitrary number of vectors are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, a framework for the function has already been written.\n",
    "Look through the code, and you'll be instructed where to make changes.\n",
    "We'll do the first two rows, and you can use this as a guide to do the last two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrices in Python\n",
    "Remember the structure for matrices in *numpy* is,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[0, 0]  A[0, 1]  A[0, 2]  A[0, 3]\n",
    "A[1, 0]  A[1, 1]  A[1, 2]  A[1, 3]\n",
    "A[2, 0]  A[2, 1]  A[2, 2]  A[2, 3]\n",
    "A[3, 0]  A[3, 1]  A[3, 2]  A[3, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can access the value of each element individually using,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[n, m]\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also access a whole row at a time using,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on last assignment, in this exercise you will need to select whole columns at a time.\n",
    "This can be done with,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "A[:, m]\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will select the m'th column (starting at zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will need to take the dot product between vectors. This can be done using the @ operator.\n",
    "To dot product vectors u and v, use the code,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "u @ v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code you should complete will be at the same level of indentation as the instruction comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to submit\n",
    "Edit the code in the cell below to complete the assignment.\n",
    "Once you are finished and happy with it, press the *Submit Assignment* button at the top of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't change any of the function names, as these will be checked by the grading script.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have further questions about submissions or programming assignments, here is a [list](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/discussions/weeks/1/threads/jB4klkn5EeibtBIQyzFmQg) of Q&A. You can also raise an issue on the discussion forum. Good luck!"
