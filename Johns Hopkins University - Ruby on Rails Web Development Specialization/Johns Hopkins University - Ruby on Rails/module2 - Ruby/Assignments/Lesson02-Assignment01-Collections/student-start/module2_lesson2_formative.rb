# Grab 23 random elements between 0 and 10000
arr = (1..10000).to_a.sample(23)
p arr

# This selects only elements that when divided by 3 have a remainder of 0 
# using the % (modulus) operator
p arr.select { |element| element % 3 == 0 }

# Using `reject` method filter out anything less than 5000
# and use `sort` and `reverse` methods to sort in descending order
# Start with the line below and continue as 1 long method chain
p arr.select { |element| element % 3 == 0 }.reject {|element| element < 5000}.sort!.reverse!
