#### Instructors: Yaakov Chaikin

Learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.

## Course include

## HTML5

- Go over HTML5 basics like valid document structure, which elements can be included inside other elements and which can not, discuss the meaning and usefulness of HTML5 semantic tags, and go over essential HTML5 tags.

## CSS3

- From the very basics of CSS3 to some fairly advanced concepts like floating and CSS rule conflict resolution. We'll go over the 'box model', background property, etc. We'll finish off the module with learning about Responsive Design using our own CSS code as well as start introducing Twitter Bootstrap with its essential Grid System.

## Coding the Static Restaurant Site

- Interacting with a client when managing a web site project and then go visit a real client at their place of business (a Chinese restaurant), help the owner figure out what she wants in a site, and get acquainted with the restaurant in general. We'll spend the rest of the module building a real web site for this business from scratch and you'll get to sit next to me and watch as the site comes together.

## Javascript

- We are going to concentrate not only on the “how” but also on the “why”, so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. We’ll cover just about everything - from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation.

## Using Javascript to Build Web Applications

- We'll learn about the protocol that the language of the web speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses, as well as how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site from Module 3 to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page.
