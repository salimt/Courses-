In Jupyter, by default, the first parameter of *sys.argv* is what started the Jupyter kernel which is not the case when executing it from the command line.  This default parameter is passed into `unittest.main( )` as an attribute when you don't explicitly pass it attributes and is therefore what causes the error about the kernel connection file not being a valid attribute. Passing an explicit list to `unittest.main( )` prevents it from looking at *sys.argv*. \n",
