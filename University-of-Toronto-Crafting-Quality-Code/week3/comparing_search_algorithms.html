		<h1>Comparing Search Algorithms</h1>
			<p>		
				We have seen two ways to search for a value in a list. Linear search works on both unsorted
				and sorted lists. Binary search works only on sorted lists.
				<br><br>
				Let's take a deeper look at each of the searching algorithms.
			</p>
			
		<h2>
			Comparing Linear Search and Binary Search

	<!--	
			<p>
				In order to analyze our searching algorithms, we must take a look at the code for each:

<!--
			<p>
				In order to make our discussion easier, we have included line numbers in the above code sample.
				<br><br>
				Analyzing the raw code is not always the best way to measure how fast the code will finish, but it
				is a great starting point. For Linear Search, we see that there are two 
				comparisons in line 17 and one assignment statement in line 18. These operations happen for each iteration
				of the <code>while</code> loop. For Binary search, things are a little more complex;
				we have two comparisons on line 45 and line 47 each. We also have two assignments on line 46 and one on line 48 or line 50 for each
				time we enter the <code>while</code> loop. Notice that for every iteration of the <code>while</code> loop, either line
				48 will execute or line 50, but not both; this is true since these lines are part of the <code>if-else</code>
				statement, and only one can run.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Since the initializations (line 15 and line 42-43) and the <code>if-else</code> blocks at the end of
				each search algorithm happen only once, regardless of the size of the list,
				we can ignore them in our comparison.
				<br><br>
				So far, we have seen that there are about 2 steps per iteration in Linear Search. We have also
				seen that there are about 4 steps per iteration in Binary Search. We are going to compare our
				algorithms in the worst cases; this happens when the item we are searching for is not actually
				in the list.
			</p>
-->			
		<h3>
			A Deeper Look at Linear Search 
		</h3>
			<p>
				Let us consider the following example in order to understand the number of steps linear search will
				take to complete:
			</p>
			
			<table border="1" style="text-align:center;">
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				  <td width="50">3</td>
				  <td width="50">4</td>
				  <td width="50">5</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>	
				Let us look for the value <code>6</code>, which does not occur in the list. We compare <code>6</code> to the item at index <code>0</code>, which is
				<code>1</code>, and since this is not the value we are looking for, we will move on to the next item. Next, we compare
				<code>6</code> to <code>2</code>. Again, we move on. We will compare <code>6</code> to <code>3</code>,
				then <code>4</code>, and then <code>5</code>. So, for a list of 5 items, we examined all 5 items in the list.
				<br><br>
				Let us make a table of the number of iterations we make as the number of items in the list grows:
			</p>
			<table border="1" style="text-align:center;">
				<tr>
				  <td width="50"># items</td>
				  <td width="50"># iters</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">3</td>
				  <td width="50">3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">.</td>
				  <td width="50">.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">.</td>
				  <td width="50">.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">.</td>
				  <td width="50">.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

		<h3>
			A Deeper Look at Binary Search 
		</h3>
			<p>
				We know that for a list with one item, the number of iterations is also one. However, what happens when there are two
				items? Well, with the first comparison, we eliminate half of the list, and we are left with one item. This leaves us with
				one more comparison. So, for a list with two items, the number of iterations is two.
				
			</p>
			
			<!--
			<table border="1" style="text-align:center;">
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				  <td width="50">3</td>
				  <td width="50">4</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			-->
			<p>
				Now, let us consider what happens when our list has 4 items: With just one comparison, we are able to eliminate half the list, and thus, we are left with only two items. 

<!--
			Here is
				how the list might look like after one iteration:
			<table border="1" style="text-align:center;">
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				  <td width="50">X</td>
				  <td width="50">X</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				The <code>X</code>s in the above diagram mark items in the list that we will no longer consider.
				--> At this point, we have
				only two items left, and we know from our previous calculation that we will need two more iterations for that.
				Therefore, for a list of 4 items, we only needed 3 iterations. Let us now construct a table with this information:
			</p>
			<table border="1" style="text-align:center;">
				<tr>
				  <td width="50"># items</td>
				  <td width="50"># iters</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">4</td>
				  <td width="50">3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">8</td>
				  <td width="50">4</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">16</td>
				  <td width="50">5</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">32</td>
				  <td width="50">6</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">64</td>
				  <td width="50">7</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">128</td>
				  <td width="50">8</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				This is very interesting! If a list has 128 items to begin with, then after only one iteration, we will only have to
				consider 64 items. This is very powerful. With one interation of the loop, we are able to eliminate half
				the list. This is only possible because the list is sorted.
			</p>
		<h2>
			Logarithms
		</h2>
			<p>
				<code>log<sub>2</sub>(n)</code> is the logarithm base <code>2</code> of <code>n</code>,
				and we can think of that as the number of times we divide <code>n</code> by 2 in
				order to reach 1. Here is quick table of values and their logarithms of base <code>2</code>:
			</p>
			

			<table border="1" style="text-align:center;">
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">n</td>
				  <td width="50"> log_2(n)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				  <td width="50">1</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">4</td>
				  <td width="50">2</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">8</td>
				  <td width="50">3</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">16</td>
				  <td width="50">4</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				  <td width="50">32</td>
				  <td width="50">5</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h2>
				Time to Run Linear and Binary Search
			</h2>
				<h3>
					Number of iterations
				</h3>
			<p>
				In Python, <code>math.log(x, b)</code> returns the logarithm of <code>x</code> to the base <code>b</code>.
			</p>
<pre>
>>> math.log(2, 2)
1.0
>>> math.log(4, 2)
2.0
>>> math.log(8, 2)
3.0
>>> math.log(16, 2)
4.0
>>> math.log(32, 2)
5.0
>>> math.log(1000000000, 2)
29.897352853986263
</pre>
			<p>
				These calculations can give us an indication of how many iterations binary search will take. Since we know that
				binary search eliminates half the list on every iteration, we can use <code>math.log(x , b)</code> to predict
				the number of iterations it will take for a list with <code>x</code> items. So, for a list with 1 billion items (1,000,000,000), binary search
				will perform about 30 iterations. On the other hand, linear search will take about 1,000,000,000 iterations
				in the worst case.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Profiling
			</h3>
				<p>
					The <code>cProfile</code> module allows us to <i>profile</i> a piece of code. By profile, we mean to measure
					how much time it takes to run, and how much memory it uses. Here is how we can time our searching functions using a module named
					<code>cProfile</code>:
				</p>
<pre>
>>> import cProfile
>>> L = list(range(10000000))
>>> len(L)
10000000
>>> cProfile.run('binary_search(L, 10000000)')
         5 function calls in 0.000 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <stdin>:1(binary_search)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <string>:1(<module>)
        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {len}
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}
>>> cProfile.run('linear_search(L, 10000000)')
         10000005 function calls in 9.146 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    6.198    6.198    9.146    9.146 <stdin>:1(linear_search)
        1    0.000    0.000    9.146    9.146 <string>:1(<module>)
 10000002    2.948    0.000    2.948    0.000 {len}
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}
</pre>
			<p>
				Looking at the above code, <code>cProfile</code> is able to give us a nice breakdown of the function calls
				involved in each searching algorithm. We see that all function calls take 0.000 seconds in binary search. However,
				in linear search, the total time spent is more than 9 seconds, and we notice that the function call to <code>len</code>
				happens 10,000,002 times. This presents an opportunity for us to save time. In our linear search algorithm,
				we can save a huge amount of time by storing the length of the list into a local variable. The new and faster linear
				search algorithm is shown below, as well as its running time:
			</p>

<pre>
>>> def linear_search(L, v):
      """ (list, object) -> int
      Return the index of the first occurrence of v in L,
      or return -1 if v is not in L.
      """
      i = 0

      length = len(L)

      while i != length and v != L[i]:
          i = i + 1

      if i == length:
          return -1
      else:
          return i6
>>> cProfile.run('linear_search(L, 10000000)')
         4 function calls in 1.872 seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    1.872    1.872    1.872    1.872 <stdin>:1(linear_search)
        1    0.000    0.000    1.872    1.872 <string>:1(<module>)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {len}
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}

</pre>

			<p>
				In the above profile, we see that <code>len</code> is called only once, as opposed to 10,000,002 times in the previous
				version of <code>linear_search(L, v)</code>. Also, the total time of linear search dropped down to about 2 seconds in this faster
				implementation of linear search.
